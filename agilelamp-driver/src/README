About this directory
--------------------

The approach to getting the code onto your system is a hack of Rubygems, which
really only wants to install libraries and executables for you. The
install-agilelamp-driver executable finds the gem directory, builds the
agilelamp binary in place using agilelamp.c, and installs it to the system
(this means agilelamp-driver won't be removed on gem uninstall either). It also
installs 44-usblamp-rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/ and restarts udev. This is to
keep the kernel from binding to the device. There is a Linux-specific call in
libusb that is also necessary, usb_detach_kernel_np.

On MacOS, it is necessary to install a "codeless kext" (a driver extension
which does not contain accompanying C code, only a *.plist metadata file) to
match the device and steal it from the kernel. sudo fetch_kext performs the
operations necessary to build and install the codeless kext to the system.
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the libusb code still does not work
on MacOS, perhaps because of something wrong with the codeless kext.
