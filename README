Project Info:
-------------
This repository hosts code to support the Agile Lamp, a lava lamp that responds
to signals over USB that is intended to be used in agile testing scenarios, for
example in a continuous integration (e.g., CruiseControl) setup. Currently
there are only 10 Agile Lamps in existence.

The main piece of software at the moment is the agilelamp-driver. This is a
userspace driver for controlling the Agile Lamp. MacOS (Leopard untested) and
Linux systems currently supported. The best option for installing the
agilelamp-driver is through rubygems (http://rubygems.org). 

Requirements
------------
* Rubygems
* System build tools (Development Tools from the second MacOS DVD/ build-essential on Debian/Ubuntu)
* Installed libusb headers (e.g., libusb installed from source on MacOS, libusb-dev on Debian/Ubuntu)

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
* sudo gem install agilelamp-driver
* sudo install-agilelamp-driver (NB: this step is necessary)
* Note carefully any compiler failure messages. These probably mean that you
 don't have the required headers installed
* If installation was successful, you should be able to type `agilelamp-driver red` 
 and the Agile Lamp will glow red. w00t!

Development Information
-----------------------
* The developers of the agilelamp-driver are big hypocrites, because the
 agilelamp-driver was not developed with TDD and does not have a test suite. We
 use TDD in our other projects, we swear!
* agilelampclient is the beginning of a GUI client for Gnome, for enabling the
 agile lamp to poll CruiseControl
* Helpful information about USB:
